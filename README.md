Football is a contest between two teams, each 
with eleven players, competing for 90 minutes 
to find a winner, with referees whose rulings 
are definitive. Nevertheless, a single referee 
often finds it challenging to make precise 
judgments due to obstructions or close plays 
that are tough to gauge, resulting in significant 
mistakes. The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) 
was implemented to minimize critical 
refereeing blunders and enhance the 
decision-making process by allowing review of 
specific game events. While VAR was 
designed to elevate the quality of officiating 
and refine decision-making, some VAR 
decisions remain debated among supporters. 
Some fans perceive VAR decisions as biased, 
whereas others argue that it has barely 
improved refereeing standards. This study will 
examine how VAR decisions influence team 
performance in football, utilizing metrics like 
overturned goals, subjective calls, and net 
score impacts. By analyzing a dataset of 20 
teams, we aim to uncover the benefits and 
drawbacks that teams experience concerning 
various VAR decisions, addressing questions 
such as whether VAR demonstrates bias 
towards particular teams, if home teams 
receive a greater advantage than away teams, 
and what effects VAR decisions have on teams 
and players overall.
